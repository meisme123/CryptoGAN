  \begin{abstract}
    In this paper we examine the efficacy, feasibility and 
    general practicality of the use of Adversarial Neural Cryptography, 
    as coined by Abadi et al. in \cite{seminalanc}, and neural cryptography
    in general. We test the recommended systems and examine their use in 
    data transmission systems for the purpose of encrypting data, and also test
    them against the standard algorithms in for this purpose today.
